The trunk for this project is just the standard WRF v3.3, as distributed by i
NCAR.  Bug fixes reported at http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/wrfv3.3/known-prob-3.3.html through 5/27/2011 have been applied to this version.

The working branch will be merged into the wrf33 trunk when it is complete
and working correctly.
